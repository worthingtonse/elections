How we will create elections using Celebrium or CloudCoin. 

0. User arrives at an marketing site: Try it for free. 
1. User logs in to a free membership site.
2. They can click a button to "Draft a New Election".
3. On the Draft New Election page, they must enter "Election Name", "Election Offices", "Election Candidates" and "Voters." Each Candidate can have a jpeg image and a statement. 
Each office gets a description. Each voter has an email and a skywallet. 
4. After they enter all that, They can click "Verify Election". The system will check to see that all the offices have candidates and all the candidates have images and statements (if required). Then they will be told how many CloudCoins they must pay and give them the opportunity to pay for them with $$. They must pay 1 CloudCoin for every voter for every candidate. Suppose there are two offices open, one for President and one for Vice-President. There are three people running for Pres and 2 people running for VP. There are 100 voters. That means that the election will cost 500 CloudCoins plus one for each voter who does not have a Skywallet. 

5. After paying, the program will generate One CloudCoin for office for every Voters. 
6. Every voter receives via email a pdf about the election and one CloudCoin for every Office. 
7. They can import their coins into their wallet. They will see a picture of the office. 
8. They can drag their coin on to the candidate of there choice.
